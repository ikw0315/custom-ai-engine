# Custom AI Engine

Custom AI Engine for rapid video analysis and learning.  
Focuses on parsing, behavior detection, and text/visual analysis,  
while sensitive datasets and learning mechanisms remain private.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to get your own copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/custom-ai-engine.git
cd custom-ai-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Run the Dummy Pipeline

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline_dummy.py
```

This simulates the full video parsing and AI analysis workflow. Results are saved automatically to `engine_state.json`.

## Local Development

* `src/` contains core classes: `VideoParser`, `Engine`, and `PipelineManager`
* `scripts/` contains example scripts to run the pipeline
* `data/` can be used to store test videos (not included for security)

## Testing

Run the dummy pipeline locally to check functionality:

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline_dummy.py
```

## Code Structure

* **VideoParser**: reads videos, extracts frames, and preps them for analysis
* **Engine**: handles AI analysis, learning, and state management
* **PipelineManager**: automates full workflow with minimal human intervention

## Security Note

⚠️ Due to security and confidentiality reasons, certain parts of the AI learning engine
and dataset are not publicly accessible. The provided code focuses on the
pipeline, parsing, and example workflows.
