# Custom AI Engine v2

Custom AI Engine v2 is a cutting-edge video learning AI system designed to process massive amounts of video data with unprecedented speed and scale. Powered by a custom engine capable of controlling up to 480 quintillion functions, each using pattern-based variable assignments, this AI performs comprehensive multi-modal analysis, including visual, textual, and behavioral data. It automatically extracts core actions, tracks repetitions, evaluates frequency, and utilizes titles, subtitles, and captions to enhance understanding. All learning results and statistics are archived for future analysis and re-training, while an autonomous pipeline allows adaptive learning and testing with minimal human intervention. Designed for scalability and precision, Custom AI Engine v2 represents the next step in advanced AI-driven video understanding.

Key features include processing thousands of videos simultaneously, recognizing main activities, logging all results for future reference, and interpreting textual context such as titles and captions to improve comprehension. Installation is straightforward: clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Usage is simple, with the core AIEngine class allowing video learning and behavioral analysis in just a few lines of code.

Contributors are welcome to fork the repository, create a new branch for their feature or bug fix, and submit a pull request. All contributions are reviewed before integration. Licensing information should be specified, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, to clarify usage and distribution permissions. Overall, Custom AI Engine v2 combines advanced AI functionality with ease of use and collaborative development, making it an ideal platform for large-scale video analysis projects.
